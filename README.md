# MediaMender üéûÔ∏è

MediaMender is a simple yet powerful Python script designed to automate the process of renaming `.mp4` files in a directory. It uses a list of new names provided in a notepad (.txt) file, where each line corresponds to the new name for each `.mp4` file. The script enhances file organization and saves substantial time and effort that would otherwise be spent on manual renaming.

## Features üåü

- **Automated Renaming:** Automatically renames all `.mp4` files in a specified directory.
- **Custom Naming:** Uses a user-provided list of names from a notepad file to rename files.
- **Error Handling:** Prevents file overwrites by checking for existing files and modifies new names slightly if necessary.
- **Efficiency:** Significantly reduces the time and effort required for file management.

## Getting Started üöÄ

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need Python installed on your system. This script was tested with Python 3.8, but it should work with most Python 3.x versions.

### Installing

1. Clone the repository or download the `.py` file to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed by running `python --version` in your terminal or command prompt.
3. Place the script in a directory of your choice.

### Usage 

1. Prepare a notepad (.txt) file with the new names for your `.mp4` files, each on a new line.
2. Update the `folder_path` variable in the script to the directory containing your `.mp4` files.
3. Update the `notepad_path` variable to the path of your notepad file.
4. Run the script with the following command:

```shell
python MediaMender.py
```

5. The script will rename the files in the directory according to the names provided in the notepad file.
